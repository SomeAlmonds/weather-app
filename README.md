# Weather forcast webpage

This is a weather website I made to practice using APIs.

## Tools used:

- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- React.js
- Sass
- Nodejs
- Express
- [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

### Notes:

- backend is hosted in another repo made by me, weather api request are made from there.
- There is definitely alot of room for imporvements to be made specially in preformance, but as of now I think it's good enough considering it's prupose.
