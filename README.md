# Weather forcast webpage

This is a weather website I made to practice using APIs.

## Tools used:

- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- React.js
- Sass
- [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

### Note:

the app.js file in the backend folder has a reference to "apiInfo.js" which is a file containing the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) url and api key in an object named api.
You'll need to make your own for the site to work.
